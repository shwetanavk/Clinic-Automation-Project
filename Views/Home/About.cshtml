    <h1>CLINIC AUTOMATION SYSTEM</h1>
    <h2>About Our Project: </h2>
    <p>
        This is a web based system which offers an easy to use interface for <i>patients, physicians and suppliers</i>.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Patients and Physicians will now be able to interact with one another online thus saving precious time and delays that are common to all clinics.
        Physicians and clinic salesmen can also reach out to suppliers and place orders for drugs and medicines based on the current available stock at the clinic.
        Suppliers will use this system to verify whether there are any orders from the clinic and approve the same based on their stock.
    </p>
    <p>
        This system supports four different types of users: Physicians, Patients, Suppliers and Salesmen.
        Apart from these users, the Admin user will be able to administer the site in general and will be able to create and modify any of the information which is used in the system.
